# Fragments Microservice

## Introduction

This cloud-based microservice is been developed for a fictional Canadian manufacturing company. This company specializes in producing automotive parts, and has been working hard for the past three years to connect, digitize, and automate all of its internal systems.

As the new system has been built, the company has identified a missing capability: many sub-systems need to be able to work with small bits of text and images. These are smaller than a traditional "document" and use a large number of different formats. For example:

- IoT devices on the manufacturing floor produce a variety of text reports that need to get stored and retrieved. Some use plain text, others CSV files, others JSON.
- Factory workers use a variety of existing mobile apps to write short status updates and reports, which need to be saved as JSON, Markdown, plain Text, and sometimes HTML.
- Automated cameras on assembly lines take regular images of damaged parts, which need to get stored for audit purposes.

The company has decided that it needs to invest in a highly scalable service for working with these so called _fragments_ of text and images. This service needs to connect seamlessly with the rest of the existing systems (e.g., use existing authorization, work over HTTP). It also needs be deployed to AWS, which is the cloud provider used for the rest of the company's systems.

## Overview

There are a number of key requirements for this new system:

1. it must provide an HTTP REST API to the existing apps, servers, and devices in the system
2. it must be possible to store, retrieve, update, and delete small fragments of text and images
3. it should be possible to convert fragment data between different formats. For example, a Markdown fragment should be retrievable as HTML, or a JPEG as a PNG. These conversions should not increase storage costs (i.e., only the original version is stored).
4. all fragment data must be stored along with information about this data, including its size, type, and creation/modification dates
5. all operations require proper authorization: nothing is publicly available, and all data should be isolated from different users in the system.
6. it must be possible to scale the system in order to store massive amounts of data
7. it must be developed in GitHub and automatically built, tested, and deployed to AWS.

A fragment is any piece of text (e.g., `text/plain`, `text/markdown`, `text/html`, etc.), JSON data (`application/json`), or an image in any of the following formats:

| Name       | Type         | Extension |
| ---------- | ------------ | --------- |
| PNG Image  | `image/png`  | `.png`    |
| JPEG Image | `image/jpeg` | `.jpg`    |
| WebP Image | `image/webp` | `.webp`   |
| GIF Image  | `image/gif`  | `.gif`    |

## 1. API Version

This is the first version of the fragments API, and all URL endpoints discussed below begin with the current version: `/v1/*`.

## 2. Authentication

Most API routes discussed below require either Basic HTTP credentials, or a JSON Web Token (JWT) to be sent along with each request in the `Authorization` header.

In many of the examples below, user credentials are sent in the `Authorization` header using `curl`:

```sh
curl -u email:password https://fragments-api.com/v1/fragments
```

_NOTE_: in the examples below, `https://fragments-api.com/` is used as the URL. However, this origin is only used for documentation purposes. It is not owned or associated with this API in any way.

## 3. Responses

Most responses from the API are returned in JSON format (`application/json`) unless otherwise specified.

Responses also include an extra `status` property, which indicates whether the request was `'ok'` or produced an `'error'`.

### 3.1 Example: successful response

Successful responses use an HTTP `2xx` status and always include a `"status": "ok"` property/value:

```json
{
  "status": "ok"
}
```

If a response includes other data, it will be included along with the `status`, for example:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "fragment": {
    "id": "V1StGXR8_Z5jdHi6B-myT",
    "ownerId": "0925f997",
    "created": "2021-11-02T15:09:50.403Z",
    "updated": "2021-11-02T15:09:50.403Z",
    "type": "text/plain",
    "size": 256
  }
}
```

### 3.2 Example: error response

Error responses use an appropriate HTTP `4xx` (client error) or `5xx` (server error), and include an `error` object, which has both the error `code` (a `number`) and a human readable error `message` (a `string`).

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": {
    "code": 400,
    "message": "invalid request"
  }
}
```

## 4. API

### 4.1 Health Check

An unauthenticated `/` route is available for checking the health of the service. If the service is running, it returns an HTTP `200` status along with the following body:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "githubUrl": "https://github.com/yourname/yourrepo",
  "version": "version from package.json"
}
```

#### 4.1.1 Example using `curl`

```sh
$ curl -i https://fragments-api.com/
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: no-cache
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
{"status":"ok","author":"David Humphrey","githubUrl":"https://github.com/humphd/fragments","version":"0.5.3"}
```

### 4.2 Fragments

The main data format of the API is the `fragment`.

#### 4.2.1 Fragment Overview

Fragments have two parts: 1) metadata (i.e., details _about_ the fragment); and 2) data (i.e., the actual binary contents of the fragment).

The fragment's **metadata** is an object that describes the fragment in the following format:

```json
{
  "id": "V1StGXR8_Z5jdHi6B-myT",
  "ownerId": "0925f997",
  "created": "2021-11-02T15:09:50.403Z",
  "updated": "2021-11-02T15:09:50.403Z",
  "type": "text/plain",
  "size": 256
}
```

The fragment's **data** is a binary blob, and represents the actual contents of the fragment (e.g., a text or image file).

#### 4.2.2 Fragment Metadata Properties

The fragment `id` is a unique, URL-friendly, string identifier, for example `V1StGXR8_Z5jdHi6B-myT`. Such ids can be generated with modules like [nanoid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nanoid), which is a [popular choice for this use case](https://planetscale.com/blog/why-we-chose-nanoids-for-planetscales-api).

The `ownerId` is the hashed email address of the user who owns this fragment. NOTE: we don't store the actual email address, only its [SHA256 hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2).

Users can only create, update, or delete fragments for themselves (i.e,. they must be authenticated).

The `created` and `updated` fields are [ISO 8601 Date strings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toISOString). This is the format used by JavaScript when _stringifying_ a `Date`: `const isoDate = JSON.stringify(new Date)`.

The `type` is a [Content Type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type), which includes the fragment's [media type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types) and possibly an optional character encoding (`charset`). The `type` describes the data (i.e., the data is text or a PNG). Valid examples of the `type` include:

1. `text/plain`
2. `text/plain; charset=utf-8`
3. `text/markdown`
4. `text/html`
5. `application/json`
6. `image/png`
7. `image/jpeg`
8. `image/webp`

NOTE: we store the entire `Content-Type` (i.e., with the `charset` if present), but also allow using only the media type (e.g., `text/html` vs. `text/html; charset=iso-8859-1`).

The `size` is the number (integer) of bytes of data stored for this fragment, and is automatically calculated when a fragment is created or updated.

### 4.3 `POST /fragments`

Creates a new fragment for the current (i.e., authenticated user). The client posts a file (raw binary data) in the `body` of the request and sets the `Content-Type` header to the desired `type` of the fragment. The `type` must be one of the supported types. This is used to generate a new fragment metadata record for the data, and then both the data and metadata are stored.

If the `Content-Type` of the fragment being sent with the request is not supported, returns an HTTP `415` with an appropriate error message.

A successful response returns an HTTP `201`. It includes a `Location` header with a full URL to use in order to access the newly created fragment, for example: `Location: https://fragments-api.com/v1/fragments/vBOV-xf6MnHP0Epw-0BVP`. See <https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.30>.

The `body` of the response includes the complete fragment metadata for the newly created fragment:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "fragment": {
    "id": "V1StGXR8_Z5jdHi6B-myT",
    "ownerId": "0925f997",
    "created": "2021-11-02T15:09:50.403Z",
    "updated": "2021-11-02T15:09:50.403Z",
    "type": "text/plain",
    "size": 256
  }
}
```

#### 4.3.1 Example using `curl`

```sh
curl -i \
  -X POST \
  -u user1@email.com:password1 \
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  -d "This is a fragment" \
  https://fragments-api.com/v1/fragments
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: https://fragments-api.com/v1/fragments/vBOV-xf6MnHP0Epw-0BVP
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 187
{
  "status": "ok",
  "fragment": {
    "id": "vBOV-xf6MnHP0Epw-0BVP",
    "created": "2021-11-08T01:04:46.071Z",
    "updated": "2021-11-08T01:04:46.073Z",
    "ownerId": "0925f997",
    "type": "text/plain",
    "size": 18
  }
}
```

### 4.4 `GET /fragments`

Gets all fragments belonging to the current user (i.e., authenticated user). NOTE: if a user has no fragments, an empty array `[]` is returned instead of an error.

The response includes a `fragments` array of `id`s:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "fragments": ["ufWr1u8900AWdHmHQGH47", "_MO1AcAOah4QIKhx5oB8J"]
}
```

Example using `curl`:

```sh
curl -i -u user1@email.com:password1 https://fragments-api.com/v1/fragments
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
{
  "status": "ok",
  "fragments": [
    "L4Z_x1VKAOAkzX3xP6Rl0",
    "vBOV-xf6MnHP0Epw-0BVP"
  ]
}
```

#### 4.4.1 `GET /fragments/?expand=1`

Gets all fragments belonging to the current user (i.e., authenticated user), expanded to include a full representations of the fragments' metadata (i.e., not just `id`). For example, using `GET /fragments?expand=1` might return:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "fragments": [
    {
      "id": "ufWr1u8900AWdHmHQGH47",
      "ownerId": "0925f997",
      "created": "2021-11-02T15:09:50.403Z",
      "updated": "2021-11-02T15:09:50.403Z",
      "type": "text/plain",
      "size": 256
    },
    {
      "id": "_MO1AcAOah4QIKhx5oB8J",
      "ownerId": "0925f997",
      "created": "2021-11-02T15:09:50.403Z",
      "updated": "2021-11-02T15:09:50.403Z",
      "type": "text/plain",
      "size": 256
    },
    {
      "id": "1b11doSmJxvO1pkqPu_P8",
      "ownerId": "0925f997",
      "created": "2021-11-02T15:09:50.403Z",
      "updated": "2021-11-02T15:09:50.403Z",
      "type": "text/plain",
      "size": 256
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 4.4.2 Example using `curl`

```sh
curl -i -u user1@email.com:password1 https://fragments-api.com/v1/fragments?expand=1
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
{
  "status": "ok",
  "fragments": [
    {
      "id": "L4Z_x1VKAOAkzX3xP6Rl0",
      "created": "2021-11-08T01:08:20.269Z",
      "updated": "2021-11-08T01:08:20.271Z",
      "ownerId": "11d4c22e",
      "type": "text/plain",
      "size": 18
    },
    {
      "id": "vBOV-xf6MnHP0Epw-0BVP",
      "created": "2021-11-08T01:04:46.071Z",
      "updated": "2021-11-08T01:04:46.073Z",
      "ownerId": "11d4c22e",
      "type": "text/plain",
      "size": 300
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4.5 `GET /fragments/:id`

Gets an authenticated user's fragment data (i.e., raw binary data) with the given `id`.

If the `id` does not represent a known fragment, returns an HTTP `404` with an appropriate error message.

If the `id` includes an optional extension (e.g., `.txt` or `.png`), the server attempts to convert the fragment to the `type` associated with that extension. Otherwise the successful response returns the raw fragment data using the `type` specified when created (e.g., `text/plain` or `image/png`) as its `Content-Type`.

For example, a Markdown fragment at `https://fragments-api.com/v1/fragments/L4Z_x1VKAOAkzX3xP6Rl0` could be automatically converted to HTML using `https://fragments-api.com/v1/fragments/L4Z_x1VKAOAkzX3xP6Rl0.html` (note the `.html` extension) or to Plain Text using `https://fragments-api.com/v1/fragments/L4Z_x1VKAOAkzX3xP6Rl0.txt` (note the `.txt` extension)

If the extension used represents an unknown or unsupported type, or if the fragment cannot be converted to this type, an HTTP `415` error is returned instead, with an appropriate message. For example, a plain text fragment cannot be returned as a PNG.

#### 4.5.1 Valid Fragment Conversions

This is the current list of valid conversions for each fragment type (others may be added in the future):

| Type               | Valid Conversion Extensions    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `text/plain`       | `.txt`                         |
| `text/markdown`    | `.md`, `.html`, `.txt`         |
| `text/html`        | `.html`, `.txt`                |
| `application/json` | `.json`, `.txt`                |
| `image/png`        | `.png`, `.jpg`, `.webp`, `gif` |
| `image/jpeg`       | `.png`, `.jpg`, `.webp`, `gif` |
| `image/webp`       | `.png`, `.jpg`, `.webp`, `gif` |
| `image/gif`        | `.png`, `.jpg`, `.webp`, `gif` |

#### 4.5.2 Example using `curl`

```sh
curl -i -u user1@email.com:password1 https://fragments-api.com/v1/fragments/L4Z_x1VKAOAkzX3xP6Rl0
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Length: 18
This is a fragment
```

Example using `curl` to convert a Markdown fragment to HTML:

```sh
curl -i -u user1@email.com:password1 https://fragments-api.com/v1/fragments/1b11doSmJxvO1pkqPu_P8.html
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 28
<h1>This is a fragment</h1>
```

### 4.6 `PUT /fragments/:id`

Allows the authenticated user to update (i.e., replace) the data for their existing fragment with the specified `id`.

If no such fragment exists with the given `id`, returns an HTTP `404` with an appropriate error message.

If the `Content-Type` of the request does not match the existing fragment's `type`, returns an HTTP `400` with an appropriate error message. A fragment's type can not be changed after it is created.

The entire request `body` is used to update the fragment's data, replacing the original value.

The successful response includes an HTTP `200` as well as updated fragment metadata:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "fragment": {
    "id": "1b11doSmJxvO1pkqPu_P8",
    "ownerId": "0925f997",
    "created": "2021-11-02T15:09:50.403Z",
    "updated": "2021-11-02T15:09:50.403Z",
    "type": "text/plain",
    "size": 1024
  }
}
```

#### 4.6.1 Example using `curl`

```sh
curl -i \
  -X PUT \
  -u user1@email.com:password1 \
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  -d "This is updated data" \
  https://fragments-api.com/v1/fragments/L4Z_x1VKAOAkzX3xP6Rl0
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 187
{
  "status": "ok",
  "fragment": {
    "id": "L4Z_x1VKAOAkzX3xP6Rl0",
    "created": "2021-11-08T01:08:20.269Z",
    "updated": "2021-11-08T01:17:21.830Z",
    "ownerId": "11d4c22e",
    "type": "text/plain",
    "size": 20,
    "formats": [
      "text/plain"
    ]
  }
}
```

### 4.7 `GET /fragments/:id/info`

Allows the authenticated user to get (i.e., read) the metadata for one of their existing fragments with the specified `id`. If no such fragment exists, returns an HTTP `404` with an appropriate error message.

The fragment's metadata is returned:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "fragment": {
    "id": "1b11doSmJxvO1pkqPu_P8",
    "ownerId": "0925f997",
    "created": "2021-11-02T15:09:50.403Z",
    "updated": "2021-11-02T15:09:50.403Z",
    "type": "text/plain",
    "size": 1024
  }
}
```

#### 4.7.1 Example using `curl`

```sh
curl -i \
  -u user1@email.com:password1 \
  https://fragments-api.com/v1/fragments/L4Z_x1VKAOAkzX3xP6Rl0/info
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 187
{
  "status": "ok",
  "fragment": {
    "id": "L4Z_x1VKAOAkzX3xP6Rl0",
    "created": "2021-11-08T01:08:20.269Z",
    "updated": "2021-11-08T01:17:21.830Z",
    "ownerId": "11d4c22e",
    "type": "text/plain",
    "size":20,
  }
}
```

### 4.8 `DELETE /fragments/:id`

Allows the authenticated user to delete one of their existing fragments with the given `id`.

If the `id` is not found, returns an HTTP `404` with an appropriate error message.

Once the fragment is deleted, an HTTP `200` is returned, along with the `ok` status:

```json
{ "status": "ok" }
```

#### 4.8.1 Example using `curl`

```sh
curl -i \
  -X DELETE \
  -u user1@email.com:password1 \
  https://fragments-api.com/v1/fragments/L4Z_x1VKAOAkzX3xP6Rl0
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 15
{ "status": "ok" }
```
